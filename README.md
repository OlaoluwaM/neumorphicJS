<h1>Neumorphic JS</h1>

<p>A small module within which I tried to make adding neumorphic effects to elements more programmatic and declarative.</p>
<p>The functionality is reverse engineered from this <a href="https://neumorphism.io/#55b9f3">wonderful web application</a> that helps generate the code for the neumorphic effect</p>

<p>Built with Javascript. Tested with Jest</p>
<p>I built this as a kind of test, to see if I could reverse engineer Neumorphism.io for the code required to generate the effect. Therefore, it is not a complete module</p>
<p>Oh, and in case you were wondering, I was successful. You can check by cloning this and running one of the test scripts</p>
